# My Book Memory (Frontend)

## Description

This React-Single Page Application (SPA) is the client-side part of the MERN-Application "My Book Memory". The corresponding server-side part of this app can be found in this repository: [My Book-Memory Server](https://github.com/ralph-the-badger/my-book-memory-server).

This application is made for users to keep track of their read book. Often people read many books and later they can't remember the books' main content or their highlighted passages. This is a pitty. Therefore, this app enables users to create book entries and to write down the book's essential content.
Users can register (with a secret access code) and login to see their own book entries. They can see their book list and explore its single book entry, they can update and delete it.
